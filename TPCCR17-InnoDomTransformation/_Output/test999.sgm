            <P>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the financial condition, financial performance,
operations and cash flows of reporting issuers of varying sizes and industries. This has specific financial
reporting implications for issuers.</P>
            <BLOCK1>
              <TI></TI>
              <P>We were encouraged by the quality of disclosures provided by many issuers significantly impacted by
COVID-19. However, we noted certain areas where boiler-plate disclosure was provided regarding the
current and expected impact of COVID-19 on an issuer’s business with insufficient detail of entity-
specific COVID-19 related risks, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of credit risks and
liquidity uncertainties. We also observed instances of unbalanced or overly promotional disclosure and
isolated non-compliance for non-GAAP financial measures (<BOLD>NGM</BOLD>s) and forward-looking information
(<BOLD>FLI</BOLD>). It is important for issuers to tailor their disclosures to provide investors with an entity-specific
level of insight to understand the operational challenges, financial impacts, risk profile and the issuer’s
operational responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such information is necessary to meet
securities requirements and to help foster investor confidence in the current environment.</P>

Many issuers provided “lists” of measures employed to manage
operational and liquidity risks but did not provide an adequate
discussion to address the anticipated impact to the issuer.
 <BOLD>Analysis of overall performance and operations</BOLD> - Most issuers
that quantitatively disclosed variances related to COVID-19 (e.g.,
impact to sales) did not explain the methodology used by
management in determining that fluctuations were isolated to
COVID-19.
 Several issuers provided limited disclosure of known trends or
events related to COVID-19 that are likely to affect future
performance.
 <BOLD>Liquidity and capital resources</BOLD> - Many issuers with material
liquidity risks did not disclose in detail their ability to meet
working capital requirements, planned growth initiatives or to fund
developmental activities and capital expenditures. Lack of
disclosure regarding trends or expected fluctuations in liquidity
taking into account events or uncertainties related to COVID-19
was commonly observed.
 <BOLD>Risk factor disclosure</BOLD> - Several issuers provided “lists” of risks
without discussion or general disclosures that touched on general
economic or societal impacts of COVID-19 and did not describe
entity-specific COVID-19-related risks.</TBLCELL>

materially by issuer and by industry.
 MD&amp;A is a standalone document. Material
operational updates should be reflected in
MD&amp;A filings to provide additional context for
analyzing financial results. Having a separate
“COVID-19” section in the MD&amp;A preceding
the discussion of financial results may provide
a useful framework in understanding the

financial condition and liquidity.</TBLCELL>

disclosed COVID-19 as the reason
for period over period variances
without analyzing entity-specific
factors.
 It was unclear for some issuers
how certain costs, in particular
restructuring costs, were fully
attributable to COVID-19 when
the issuer had pre-existing
operational issues.
 Most issuers that quantitatively
disclosed variances related to
COVID-19 (e.g., impact to sales)
did not explain the methodology
used by management in
determining that fluctuations were
isolated to COVID-19.
 Some issuers did not disclose the
impacts that government assistance
attributable to COVID-19 had on
their performance, operations and
cash flows.</TBLCELL>

negative results to COVID-19. Instead,
provide a meaningful discussion on the
material impacts (both positive and negative)
of COVID-19 on the issuer’s operations.
Disclose issuer-specific impacts on both
revenues and expenses and provide disclosure
by segment.
 Issuers must have a basis for attributing costs
to COVID-19, especially when certain
conditions existed prior to COVID-19. Other
reasons for material fluctuations not related to
COVID-19 should be disclosed with equal
prominence.
 Quantification of material factors, where
practicable, can provide an understanding of an
issuer’s performance. However, it may be
difficult for an issuer to determine with
accuracy the quantitative impact of COVID-19.
In order to avoid misleading investors, issuers
should explain the methodology used in their
calculation and provide information about the
judgements and estimations made by
management when quantifying impacts.
 An understanding of the amounts of government
assistance received and where such funding is
recorded in the financial statements may be
necessary to understand historical results and
future trends, when material. Issuers are reminded
to provide balanced disclosure of both the positive
and adverse impacts to operations, financial
condition and cash flows. Also see “<EM>Appendix

liquidity and funding risks.
 Issuers that have material liquidity risks might
consider disclosing: their most current working
capital amount, significant obligations that are
maturing in the short term, their cash burn rate
on a monthly or quarterly basis, the period of
time that they expect to be able to fund
operations and how they intend to prioritize
expenditures in the short term.
<BOLD>Issuers should:</BOLD>
 Provide a clear picture of the issuers working
capital, working capital needs and how those
needs relate to business plans and milestones
 Detail liquidity risks including risk of default or
arrears on distributions, lease and debt
payments
 Discuss the impact of altered payment terms
with customers and lessees
 Discuss whether the issuer’s cost or access to
capital has changed
 Quantify the impact of remedies where possible
 Discuss how financing sources (e.g.,
public/private offerings, unused lines of credit)
meet the issuers immediate and longer-term
liquidity needs
 Discuss how long other remedies to address
liquidity concerns are anticipated to be in effect
and the risks to the issuer when remedies expire
 Consider what additional information
management is monitoring in relation to
liquidity that may be useful information to
investors
 Discuss known trends or events that may
impact future liquidity and capital resources
(e.g., what events or uncertainties may impact
ability to service debt, meet other financial
obligations or access financing?)
 Update material factors impacting liquidity and
capital resources up to the date of the MD&amp;A
<BOLD>Reference: Item1.6 and Item 1.7 of Form 51-
102F1</BOLD>
 We encourage issuers with debt covenants to
discuss the terms and conditions of the debt
covenants, especially when a breach of the
covenant could trigger a material funding
requirement or early repayment.
 If an issuer is close to breaching covenants or at
risk of default in future periods, this is material
information to be disclosed.
 Discuss any additional requirements in
agreements with lenders that may restrict the
issuer’s business or access to other financing.</TBLCELL>

 A common deficiency was the lack
of disclosure regarding trends or
expected fluctuations in an issuer’s
liquidity and capital resources,
taking into account events or
uncertainties related to COVID-19.
 Many issuers discussed a wide
range of remedies to address
liquidity uncertainties. However,
some issuers did not quantify the
impact or discuss how long certain
remedies will remain in effect.
<BOLD>Industry Observations</BOLD>:
 We observed additional disclosure
regarding customers/tenants to
help understand the issuer’s
liquidity risk and future trends.
<BOLD>For example:</BOLD> some real estate
issuers disclosed % of tenants
undergoing restructuring, cash
rents received during the period
and categorized their tenant base
based on management’s
assessment of risk.</TBLCELL>

 Ability to sustain changes in

 Changes in consumer demand
 Ability to access government funding
 Requirements under lending agreements
 Changes in commodity prices
 Volatility in the capital markets and access to

 Limitations on the ability of issuers’ customers to
perform and make timely payments
 Reliance on major customers that have decreased

 Disruption to supply chains

 If management determined there were no

going concern that were addressed by mitigating
actions judged sufficient to conclude the going

such situations are commonly referred to as a

Issuers are required to disclose the following:
 An explanation of the inputs, assumptions and
judgments made in estimating ECL
 The quantitative and qualitative factors taken
into account in determining what constitutes a
SICR
 An issuer’s definitions of default, including the
reasons for selecting those definitions
 An issuer’s write-off policy, including the
indicators that there is no reasonable expectation
of recovery
 How forward-looking information has been
incorporated into the determination of ECL.
Forward-looking information can include
macroeconomic information, for example:
unemployment rate, GDP growth rate, housing
price index/home price index growth rate, and
interest rate forecasts. Staff expect that forward-
looking information should take COVID-19
impacts into consideration.
 Information about credit risk management
practices and any significant changes to credit
risk exposure, which may in part be due to the
impact of COVID-19.
<BOLD>Other considerations:</BOLD>
 Relying solely on historic loss rates in determining
ECL would not be appropriate if the entity has been,
or is expected to be, impacted by the pandemic.
 It may be difficult at this time to incorporate the
specific effects of the pandemic (e.g. government
support and customer relief measures) into the ECL
models as systems may not be calibrated to address
the impacts of COVID-19. When it is not possible
to reflect such information in models, issuers should
consider post-model overlays or adjustments, and
provide adequate disclosure of those overlays and
adjustments.
 Other disclosure considerations include:
o The values of the key macroeconomic inputs used in
the multiple economic scenario analysis and the
probability weights of these scenarios.
o The assumptions used to determine how the
different challenges for specific sectors and regions
have been taken into account.
o If material, issuers may consider disclosing further
details about payment deferral programs such as the
amount and nature of the total principal balance
outstanding within payment deferral/payment
holiday programs provided to borrowers as a result</TBLCELL>

<BOLD>Financial Institutions</BOLD>
 Some issuers disclosed an elevated
level of credit risk on their
material financial assets by each
asset class in light of the outbreak
of COVID-19 and updated the key
assumptions considered by
management and their strategies to
strengthen their risk profile (e.g.,
through temporarily reducing risk
appetite for certain asset classes or
increasing loan-to-value ratios).
 Some issuers disclosed increased
ECL or provided an adequate
explanation regarding their
expectation that COVID-19 will
not significantly impair their
capital position and credit quality.
 Many issuers that provided loan
deferral programs/payment
holidays to borrowers during
COVID-19 pandemic also
discussed the impact of these
changes on risk of default and
discussed the impact of these
deferrals, including that the
deferral of payments may not
immediately or always result in a
significant increase in credit risk
(SICR).
 Some issuers did not update their
sensitivity analysis or disclose
adjustments/overlays to the ECL
model in their financial statements
that may have been necessary due
to COVID-19 pandemic.
<BOLD>Useful disclosure observed:</BOLD>
 Some issuers used sensitivity
analysis with respect to the ECL
model by providing multi-factor
sensitivities to show the impact of
possible changes in multiple
assumptions affecting the ECL
allowance.
 A few issuers tailored the forward-
looking information incorporated
in determining their ECL to reflect
the changes in characteristics of
individual loan books (e.g.,

reviewed disclosed NGMs adjusted

 In certain cases where a NGM was
disclosed, issuers did not adequately

attributable to the pandemic and/or

 CSA staff found a few instances
where the disclosure of NGMs was
potentially misleading as the issuer:
adjusted for expenses attributable to
COVID-19 without adjusting for
government subsidies or attempted to
“normalize” revenue or expenses for

19 impacts, consider how it assists investors,
how management uses the measure and why
management believes it is a useful and
meaningful alternative to explain the impact of
COVID-19.
 Consider whether the adjustment matches the
corresponding usefulness of the NGM and the
disclosure is balanced (i.e., whether both
positive and negative components are
disclosed).
 As the pandemic continues, there may be a
limited basis for management to conclude that
an adjustment is non-recurring, infrequent or
unusual even if the item is directly related to
COVID-19.
 Be specific in describing adjustments (and not
simply disclose, for instance, “other costs
related to COVID”.
 If disclosing NGMs adjusted for COVID-19,
include balanced adjustments and consider the
impacts of government subsidies, insurance
recoveries and relief from landlords.
 All adjustments should be based on actual
results. Adjustments that attempt to estimate or
forecast results as if the pandemic had not
occurred are not appropriate.</TBLCELL>

should refer to their principal regulator’s

of “material change”.
 If COVID-19 has an equal effect throughout an
issuer’s industry, a material change report may not
be required.
 Issuers should be aware of the impact of COVID-

includes:</BOLD>
 Material changes in distributions or dividends
 Changes in credit arrangements
 Significant disruptions to an issuer’s workforce or

 Negative changes in markets, economy or laws
 Supply chain delays or disruptions that are critical
to an issuer’s business
 Increased cost of goods or services
 Suspension of exports

closed as at the date of this MD&amp;A. 14 locations remained open during the quarter for take-out only. In order

negatively affected by COVID-19. The closures noted above were in effect for 2 weeks during the
reporting period. Based on our estimate for each location, the loss in revenues due to store closures was
approximately $3M for Q3, 2020 (based on a 2-week average sales at those stores in prior periods). A
further reduction of revenue of $4M is estimated from locations that remained open as take-out only or
were subject to reduced capacity limits for Q3, 2020 due to a reduction in revenue/hour from the loss of
customers dining in and shorter operating times.</P>

Company’s current debt profile and the ongoing uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact
compliance with the total leverage ratio and interest coverage covenants at December 31, 2020. Management has
been negotiating with its syndicate of lenders and has entered into an amended agreement under its credit facility.
Under the amended agreement, the Company is subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 5.5 and minimum interest
coverage ratio of 2.5 from Q4, 2020 to Q2, 2021. The Company has incurred fees and expenses of $1 million to
date to implement these amendments and expects to incur another $0.5 million in Q4 2020.</P>

Governments have imposed measures to contain the outbreak, including business closures, travel restrictions,
quarantines and social distancing measures. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a sharp decline in
global economic growth as well as causing increased volatility in financial markets. If the COVID-19 pandemic
is prolonged, the adverse impact on the global economy could worsen. Accordingly, the full impact of the
COVID-19 is uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on the Company.</P>

operating at a reduced occupancy as a result of mandatory closure orders from various government authorities. In
light of this temporary closure and a material decrease in the Company’s market value due to a sharp decline in
its share price, the Company concluded that this segment, which is a cash generating unit (“CGU”), should be
tested for impairment at period end. The Company did not identify any further indicators of impairment or
impairment reversals for its other CGU's.</P>

The
Company calculates value in use using a five-year discounted cash flow method based on the most recent
financial budget forecasts approved by management. The future cash flows are based on a range of
estimates and assumptions, including growth in average sales from XX% to XX% for the period 2020-202X to
reflect a staged reopening and other scenarios and a pre-tax discount rate of XX% (which represents the weighted
average cost of capital). For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a total
impairment charge of $XXX million relating to the entire goodwill balance allocated to this CGU of $XX million
and an impairment on the PP&amp;E in this CGU of $XXX million. The recoverable amount of the Company’s
impaired CGU at September 30, 2020 was $XXX million.</P>

manage costs, and the future availability of equity or debt financing. Whether and when the Company can
generate sufficient operating cash flows to pay for its expenditures and settle its obligations as they fall due is

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, management expects decreased demand for our products for the
remainder of 2020 and 2021. As a result, management has reorganized its operations to streamline
production and reduce head office staff. These restructuring costs include the cost of laying off XX
employees and the cost of shifting the majority of the production to manufacturing plant A. Additional
restructuring costs are expected in Q1,2021, although the majority of the restructuring costs have already
been incurred. Please refer to the COVID-19 impact section of the company’s MD&amp;A and the restructuring
costs note in the financial statements, filed concurrently with this news release, for additional details on the
impact of COVID-19 on the company’s operations.</P>
