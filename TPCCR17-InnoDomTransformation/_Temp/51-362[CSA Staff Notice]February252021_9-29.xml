 Most issuers that quantitatively
disclosed variances related to

did not explain the methodology
used by management in
determining that fluctuations were
isolated to COVID-19.

 Avoid simply making statements attributing
negative results to COVID-19. Instead,
provide a meaningful discussion on the
material impacts (both positive and negative)
of COVID-19 on the issuer’s operations.
Disclose issuer-specific impacts on both
revenues and expenses and provide disclosure
by segment.
 Issuers must have a basis for attributing costs
to COVID-19, especially when certain
conditions existed prior to COVID-19. Other
reasons for material fluctuations not related to
COVID-19 should be disclosed with equal
prominence.
 Quantification of material factors, where
practicable, can provide an understanding of an
issuer’s performance. However, it may be
difficult for an issuer to determine with
accuracy the quantitative impact of COVID-19.
In order to avoid misleading investors, issuers
should explain the methodology used in their
calculation and provide information about the
judgements and estimations made by
management when quantifying impacts.
 An understanding of the amounts of government
assistance received and where such funding is
recorded in the financial statements may be
necessary to understand historical results and
future trends, when material. Issuers are reminded
to provide balanced disclosure of both the positive
and adverse impacts to operations, financial
condition and cash flows. Also see “<EM>Appendix

capital, working capital needs and how those
needs relate to business plans and milestones
 Detail liquidity risks including risk of default or
arrears on distributions, lease and debt
payments
 Discuss the impact of altered payment terms
with customers and lessees
 Discuss whether the issuer’s cost or access to
capital has changed
 Quantify the impact of remedies where possible
 Discuss how financing sources (e.g.,
public/private offerings, unused lines of credit)
meet the issuers immediate and longer-term
liquidity needs
 Discuss how long other remedies to address
liquidity concerns are anticipated to be in effect
and the risks to the issuer when remedies expire
 Consider what additional information
management is monitoring in relation to
liquidity that may be useful information to
investors
 Discuss known trends or events that may
impact future liquidity and capital resources
(e.g., what events or uncertainties may impact
ability to service debt, meet other financial
obligations or access financing?)
 Update material factors impacting liquidity and
capital resources up to the date of the MD&amp;A

 A common deficiency was the lack
of disclosure regarding trends or
expected fluctuations in an issuer’s
liquidity and capital resources,
taking into account events or
uncertainties related to COVID-19.
 Many issuers discussed a wide
range of remedies to address
liquidity uncertainties. However,
some issuers did not quantify the
impact or discuss how long certain
remedies will remain in effect.
<BOLD>Industry Observations</BOLD>:
 We observed additional disclosure
regarding customers/tenants to
help understand the issuer’s
liquidity risk and future trends.
<BOLD>For example:</BOLD> some real estate
issuers disclosed % of tenants
undergoing restructuring, cash
rents received during the period
and categorized their tenant base
based on management’s
assessment of risk.</TBLCELL>

 When management is aware of material
uncertainties in relation to COVID-19 that may
cast significant doubt upon the issuer’s ability to
continue as a going concern, those uncertainties
are required to be disclosed.
 If management determined there were no
material uncertainties that cast significant doubt
on the issuer’s ability to continue as a going
concern, but there were significant doubts about
going concern that were addressed by mitigating
actions judged sufficient to conclude the going
concern basis of accounting is appropriate, then
such situations are commonly referred to as a
“close call”. In these situations, issuers are
required to disclose the significant judgments to
support their determination that going concern is
appropriate, including those mitigating actions
that impacted their determination that material
uncertainties have been addressed (i.e.,
successful negotiations of credit facilities
subsequent to period end or the identification of
other feasible sources of financing).

 In certain cases where a NGM was

attributable to the pandemic and/or
were non-recurring.
 CSA staff found a few instances
where the disclosure of NGMs was
potentially misleading as the issuer:
adjusted for expenses attributable to
COVID-19 without adjusting for
government subsidies or attempted to
“normalize” revenue or expenses for
the year-to-date period based on more
positive results for one quarter.</TBLCELL>
                    <TBLCELL ROWSEP="HSINGLE" COLSTART="4"> Before presenting NGMs adjusted for COVID-
19 impacts, consider how it assists investors,
how management uses the measure and why
management believes it is a useful and
meaningful alternative to explain the impact of
COVID-19.
 Consider whether the adjustment matches the
corresponding usefulness of the NGM and the
disclosure is balanced (i.e., whether both
positive and negative components are
disclosed).
 As the pandemic continues, there may be a
limited basis for management to conclude that
an adjustment is non-recurring, infrequent or
unusual even if the item is directly related to
COVID-19.
 Be specific in describing adjustments (and not
simply disclose, for instance, “other costs
related to COVID”.
 If disclosing NGMs adjusted for COVID-19,
include balanced adjustments and consider the
impacts of government subsidies, insurance
recoveries and relief from landlords.
 All adjustments should be based on actual
results. Adjustments that attempt to estimate or
forecast results as if the pandemic had not
occurred are not appropriate.</TBLCELL>

the issuer’s business and industry.

        As described above, we shut down 25 locations country-wide in mid-September, and these locations remain
closed as at the date of this MD&amp;A. 14 locations remained open during the quarter for take-out only. In order
to mitigate the impacts of store closures and reduced revenues, we have temporarily laid off certain staff. Our
mitigating efforts are described in further detail in the Recent Developments section.
      </P>
          <P>Revenue decreased by 30% from Q3, 2019 due to an estimated loss of sales of $7M from restaurants
negatively affected by COVID-19. The closures noted above were in effect for 2 weeks during the
reporting period. Based on our estimate for each location, the loss in revenues due to store closures was
approximately $3M for Q3, 2020 (based on a 2-week average sales at those stores in prior periods). A
further reduction of revenue of $4M is estimated from locations that remained open as take-out only or
were subject to reduced capacity limits for Q3, 2020 due to a reduction in revenue/hour from the loss of
customers dining in and shorter operating times.</P>
          <P>Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses decreased by $5M from Q3, 2019:</P>
          <P>The decrease reflects an estimated $2M in rent savings and a decrease in $2M of wages based on
management’s calculation of the impact of location closures and reduced capacity limits.</P>
          <P>In Q3 2020, the Company also benefitted from $1.5M due to the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy
Program, of which $1M was recorded as a reduction to SG&amp;A expenses, and $500K as a reduction to
cost of sales which allows the Company to maintain a comparable gross margin to the prior period.</P>

The Company has implemented a series of cost reduction measures in response to COVID-19. These measures
include the following: suspension of the quarterly dividend, reduced compensation, reduction of discretionary
spending, delayed capital projects, sales of assets and taking advantage of the Canadian Emergency Wage
Subsidy Program. The Company is monitoring the situation and will adjust these measures as the situation
evolves.</P>

        The Company now expects that the combination of lower expected EBITDA in 2020 combined with the
Company’s current debt profile and the ongoing uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact
compliance with the total leverage ratio and interest coverage covenants at December 31, 2020. Management has
been negotiating with its syndicate of lenders and has entered into an amended agreement under its credit facility.
Under the amended agreement, the Company is subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 5.5 and minimum interest
coverage ratio of 2.5 from Q4, 2020 to Q2, 2021. The Company has incurred fees and expenses of $1 million to
date to implement these amendments and expects to incur another $0.5 million in Q4 2020.

        On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
Governments have imposed measures to contain the outbreak, including business closures, travel restrictions,
quarantines and social distancing measures. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a sharp decline in
global economic growth as well as causing increased volatility in financial markets. If the COVID-19 pandemic
is prolonged, the adverse impact on the global economy could worsen. Accordingly, the full impact of the
COVID-19 is uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

          <P>Consumer demand will continue to be the Company’s most significant risk due to the uncertainty in the
global economy, negatively impacting our retail stores. Many of our stores are located in areas that
historically have had higher densities of tourism and will experience a greater negative impact and slower
recovery than perhaps other retailers. While eCommerce sales have increased, we expect to continue to incur
significant sales losses as overall customer demand and consumer spending is expected to continue to</P>

      </P>
          <P>Social distancing restrictions to protect the safety of our customers and employees may limit both the number
of customers we can serve at our retail stores, and the volume of goods we are able to fulfill through our
distribution centre. More severe government-imposed restrictions, including store capacity restrictions and
lockdowns, could further restrict our ability to service our customers. See also “Subsequent Events” for
further discussion on store closures in relation to COVID-19.</P>
          <P>We may also face supply chain challenges if there are disruptions in service at our distribution centre,
suppliers, or logistics providers. Increased market demand for logistic providers may continue to increase our
operating costs and/or limit our ability to fulfill sales.</P>
          <P>The costs of operating our stores and distribution centre may continue to increase due to enhanced health and
safety measures taken to protect our employees, including the increased costs of personal protective
equipment.</P>
          <P>Access to government financial assistance programs may place restrictions on our business and operations,
including our ability to deploy capital or return capital to our shareholders.</P>
          <P>
        While the full-extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business remains uncertain, we believe that
the cost reductions and liquidity management strategies employed will partially mitigate the above risks as further

        The majority of the Company’s operations in segment XYZ were closed, and currently remain closed or are
operating at a reduced occupancy as a result of mandatory closure orders from various government authorities. In
light of this temporary closure and a material decrease in the Company’s market value due to a sharp decline in
its share price, the Company concluded that this segment, which is a cash generating unit (“CGU”), should be
tested for impairment at period end. The Company did not identify any further indicators of impairment or
impairment reversals for its other CGU's.
      </P>
          <P>
        The recoverable amount for the CGU has been estimated using a discounted cash flow (value in use) model. The
Company calculates value in use using a five-year discounted cash flow method based on the most recent
financial budget forecasts approved by management. The future cash flows are based on a range of
estimates and assumptions, including growth in average sales from XX% to XX% for the period 2020-202X to
reflect a staged reopening and other scenarios and a pre-tax discount rate of XX% (which represents the weighted
average cost of capital). For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a total
impairment charge of $XXX million relating to the entire goodwill balance allocated to this CGU of $XX million
and an impairment on the PP&amp;E in this CGU of $XXX million. The recoverable amount of the Company’s
impaired CGU at September 30, 2020 was $XXX million.
      </P>
          <P>
        The Company conducts sensitivity analyses by varying the pre-tax discount rate upward by X% and the growth
rates down by X%. Such sensitivity analyses demonstrate that a reasonable change in assumptions would not
result in the CGU’s carrying value exceeding its value in use.

          <P>1. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, management expects decreased demand for our products for the
remainder of 2020 and 2021. As a result, management has reorganized its operations to streamline
production and reduce head office staff. These restructuring costs include the cost of laying off XX
employees and the cost of shifting the majority of the production to manufacturing plant A. Additional
restructuring costs are expected in Q1,2021, although the majority of the restructuring costs have already
been incurred. Please refer to the COVID-19 impact section of the company’s MD&amp;A and the restructuring
costs note in the financial statements, filed concurrently with this news release, for additional details on the
impact of COVID-19 on the company’s operations.</P>
          <P>2. The Company received government assistance from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program
(CEWS). During Q3, 2020, the Company recorded $2M of wage subsidies as a reduction of salary expenses.
More information about government assistance is included in the MD&amp;A.</P>
