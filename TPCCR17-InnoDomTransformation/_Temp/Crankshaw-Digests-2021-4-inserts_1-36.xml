burn down his ex-girlfriend K’s mother’s home, and breach of an undertaking. After

ascertain consent. The fact that the complainants may have consented to flirtatious
behaviour did not mean that they consented to the unwanted sexual touching that
formed the basis of the charges. In the absence of evidence that the accused took
reasonable steps to ascertain consent, there was no reason to consider the
presence or absence of reasonable grounds to support an honest belief in consent,

defence counsel failed to advise him that his ability to challenge the lawfulness of a

the accused had failed to establish that it would be unfair to permit the guilty plea
to stand. The accused’s appeal from conviction was allowed. The trial judge erred
by failing to consider whether the evidence adduced on the strike plea application
established a reasonable possibility that the accused would not have pleaded guilty
had he been aware that doing so would preclude a challenge to the search warrant.

have pleaded guilty on those circumstances. The guilty plea was set aside, the

criminal record, including the underlying facts of a 2003 conviction for assault, was
admissible as fresh evidence related to the integrity of the trial process. The
Crown’s failure to disclose the complainant’s prior record limited a line of inquiry
related to the complainant’s credibility and insulated him from scrutiny to some
extent, but did not deprive the defence from garnering additional evidence that
would ultimately have affected the trial judge’s material findings. While the fact of
the complainant’s criminal record was relevant to his credibility generally, given the
content of the record, there was no reasonable possibility that cross-examination
on that record would have had an impact on the decision to convict. The non-
disclosure did not deprive the accused of realistic opportunities to explore possible

cocaine behind the stereo console. The accused, who was the sole occupant, was
not the registered owner of the vehicle, but several documents found in the vehicle
connected it to the accused. The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for
the purpose of trafficking. The trial judge addressed the accused’s argument that
someone else could have surreptitiously hidden the cocaine behind the stereo
console without his knowledge. He concluded that the quantity and value of the
seized drugs made it inconceivable that the drugs would be casually entrusted to
someone who did not know what was in the vehicle. He also found the use of a
third-party vehicle consistent with evidence that third-party vehicles are used to
transport drugs. The accused’s appeal was dismissed. The circumstantial evidence
established a constellation of factors that together supported the inference that the
accused knew about the presence of drugs in the vehicle. Only alternative
inferences that are reasonable are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. The trial
judge properly concluded that the accused’s theory did not cross the line from
speculation to “plausible theory” or “reasonable possibility”.</FONT>

his involvement consisted of allowing his residence to be used for the importation of
fentanyl for his supplier in exchange for free fentanyl. While he was on bail, a
second package from China was successfully delivered to his address and signed
for. The accused’s appeal from a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment was
dismissed. Sentences for importing or trafficking in fentanyl should reflect the
dangerousness of that drug. Despite his awareness of how dangerous fentanyl is,
the accused stored it at his home, where his partner and two young children
resided, demonstrating a lack of concern for the risk to others. He had refused to

The application judge held that, based on the evidentiary record, there was a
likelihood of the accused being able to adduce evidence against third parties, and
that it would therefore be inaccurate to say that he was unable to raise a
reasonable doubt about his guilt without the privileged information. The accused’s
appeal from his subsequent conviction was dismissed. The application judge
correctly found that the “innocence at stake” exception to informer privilege did not
apply as the accused had other evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt. While

application was dismissed. The criminal corruption charges against F did not call
into question either the search warrant or the accused’s arrest. F was a sub-affiant
in the Information to Obtain the search warrant. If F’s observations of the accused
were excised from the ITO, what remained was sufficient to support the issuance of
the warrant. Similarly, the arresting officer had reasonable and probable grounds to
arrest the accused apart from F’s surveillance observations. There was no
reasonable possibility that the information or material sought might assist the
accused in the pursuit of his appeal.</FONT>

were involved in a physical altercation in the washroom of a pub. Both men claimed
that they acted in self-defence after the other instigated the fight. The trial judge
rejected the accused’s evidence. On the accused’s appeal, the complainant’s
criminal record, including the underlying facts of his 2003 conviction for assault,
was admissible as fresh evidence related to the integrity of the trial process. The
Crown’s failure to disclose the complainant’s prior record limited a line of inquiry
related to the complainant’s credibility and insulated him from scrutiny to some
extent, but did not deprive the defence from garnering additional evidence that
would ultimately have affected the trial judge’s material findings. While the fact of
the complainant’s criminal record was relevant to his credibility generally, given the
content of the record, there was no reasonable possibility that cross-examination
on that record would have had an impact on the decision to convict. The non-
disclosure did not deprive the accused of realistic opportunities to explore possible
uses of the record for purposes of investigation and gathering evidence.</FONT>

placing three 20k bags of caustic soda and five bags of kitty litter in his vehicle.
One of the officers smelled sassafras and noted four CCTV cameras at one of the
properties under surveillance. That information was set out in Informations to
Obtain search warrants for three locations associated with the accused. The trial
judge found that the ITOs did not set out a sufficient basis for the issuance of the
warrants, quashed the warrants, and found that the searches violated the accused’s

          <FONT font-name="Verdana" font-size="11.00pt">. In doing so, he exceeded the bounds of permissible
review of the warrants. He erred by asking whether the surveillance observations
could have had innocent explanations, rather than asking whether they could
properly be given some weight by the issuing judge. With respect to the officer’s
olfactory observations, he erred in admitting defence evidence from a chemist
about the smell produced by MDMA production, as that witness had no relevant
expertise. In any event, expert evidence will rarely be helpful in the limited inquiry
that should be conducted on a sub-facial challenge to a warrant.</FONT>

comply with the “knock and announce” requirement was justified both for safety
reasons and in order to prevent the destruction of evidence. Given the size and
layout of the house’s two levels (with the potential for multiple washrooms) and the
nature of the drugs (oxycodone pills that could easily be flushed), there was a real
likelihood that the accused would be able to destroy the evidence quickly. Although
the officers had no information that there were firearms in the house, the
allegations involved serious drug charges, and the typical combination of drugs and
guns was well-known to the police. To some degree, the police must be entitled to
rely upon their collective experience when approaching situations that may

months and five days was presumptively unreasonable, but the trial judge found
that exceptional circumstances existed which rebutted the presumption, as the
delay was principally caused by the parties’ good faith but mistaken estimate of the
number of days required for the trial. Once the period of three months and 28 days
resulting from that mistaken estimate was deducted, the delay fell below the
presumptive ceiling. The accused’s application for a stay of proceedings for
unreasonable delay was dismissed. His appeal from conviction was dismissed. The

intended to call 26 witnesses, many of those witnesses were being called solely to
establish the provenance of documents and records, and the testimony of the

black male was in a group of black males in a particular apartment building and had

on firearms charges, the accused applied to exclude the firearm and an inculpatory
statement that he made after asserting his wish to speak to counsel and before he
was given an opportunity to do so. The application was allowed. There was nothing
