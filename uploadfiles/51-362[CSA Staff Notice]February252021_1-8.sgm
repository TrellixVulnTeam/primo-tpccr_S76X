                <P>The Canadian Securities Administrators (<BOLD>CSA</BOLD>) have prepared this Staff Notice (<BOLD>Notice</BOLD>) to report the
results of recently completed continuous disclosure reviews (<BOLD>reviews</BOLD>) conducted by CSA staff (<BOLD>staff or
we</BOLD>) of the disclosures provided by reporting issuers<SUP>1</SUP> on the impact of COVID-19 to their business. Since
the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has
had a material adverse impact on the economy and is posing widespread business challenges for many
issuers, including reporting on and disclosing the business impact of COVID-19.</P>

                  <TI></TI>
                  <P>This issue-oriented review assessed compliance of issuers’ disclosures of the current and anticipated
impacts related to COVID-19 on their respective operations, financial condition, liquidity and future
prospects. The reviews also assessed key financial reporting areas applicable to issuers that may be
subject to significant judgement and measurement uncertainty in the current environment.</P>
                  <BLOCK1>
                    <TI></TI>
                    <P>We recognize that issuers are preparing disclosure in a rapidly changing environment. However,
meaningful disclosures about the business impacts and potential uncertainties regarding COVID-19 are
needed for investors to make informed investment decisions. This Notice summarizes our key review
findings and includes some disclosure examples and guidance to assist reporting issuers and their advisors
with disclosing and reporting on the impact of COVID-19 to their business and operations.</P>

                      <P>We will continue to closely monitor issuers’ continuous disclosure (<BOLD>CD</BOLD>) filings in relation to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of our ongoing CSA CD review program. For further details, see CSA
Staff Notice 51-312 (revised) <EM>Harmonized Continuous Disclosure Review Program</EM><SUP>2</SUP><EM>.</EM> An issuer’s

COVID-19. However, we noted certain areas where boiler-plate disclosure was provided regarding the
current and expected impact of COVID-19 on an issuer’s business with insufficient detail of entity-
specific COVID-19 related risks, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of credit risks and
liquidity uncertainties. We also observed instances of unbalanced or overly promotional disclosure and
isolated non-compliance for non-GAAP financial measures (<BOLD>NGM</BOLD>s) and forward-looking information
(<BOLD>FLI</BOLD>). It is important for issuers to tailor their disclosures to provide investors with an entity-specific
level of insight to understand the operational challenges, financial impacts, risk profile and the issuer’s
operational responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such information is necessary to meet
securities requirements and to help foster investor confidence in the current environment.</P>

Many issuers provided “lists” of measures employed to manage
operational and liquidity risks but did not provide an adequate
discussion to address the anticipated impact to the issuer.
 <BOLD>Analysis of overall performance and operations</BOLD> - Most issuers
that quantitatively disclosed variances related to COVID-19 (e.g.,
impact to sales) did not explain the methodology used by
management in determining that fluctuations were isolated to
COVID-19.
 Several issuers provided limited disclosure of known trends or
events related to COVID-19 that are likely to affect future
performance.
 <BOLD>Liquidity and capital resources</BOLD> - Many issuers with material
liquidity risks did not disclose in detail their ability to meet
working capital requirements, planned growth initiatives or to fund
developmental activities and capital expenditures. Lack of
disclosure regarding trends or expected fluctuations in liquidity
taking into account events or uncertainties related to COVID-19
was commonly observed.
 <BOLD>Risk factor disclosure</BOLD> - Several issuers provided “lists” of risks
without discussion or general disclosures that touched on general
economic or societal impacts of COVID-19 and did not describe
entity-specific COVID-19-related risks.</TBLCELL>

<BOLD>Appendix B – Disclosure Examples</BOLD> where we have included some examples of deficient disclosure
contrasted against improved entity-specific disclosure. The observations and disclosure considerations
presented do not represent an exhaustive list and do not represent all the requirements that could apply to
a particular issuer’s situation. Issuers should consider their specific business and operations and provide
clear and transparent disclosure of the impact of COVID-19.</P>

disclosure in MD&amp;A filings.
<BOLD>Useful disclosure observed:</BOLD>
 Many affected issuers significantly
expanded their MD&amp;A to explain
the impact of COVID-19 to the
issuer’s industry, operations,
customers, suppliers etc. Several
issuers disclosed industry and
relevant operational information to
help users frame and understand
the effects on the issuer’s financial
results.</TBLCELL>

on how COVID-19 has altered the issuer’s
industry and day to day operations. Insight
should be provided into the issuer’s current
operating status and the operational challenges
that management is monitoring. This will vary
materially by issuer and by industry.
 MD&amp;A is a standalone document. Material
operational updates should be reflected in
MD&amp;A filings to provide additional context for
analyzing financial results. Having a separate
“COVID-19” section in the MD&amp;A preceding
the discussion of financial results may provide
a useful framework in understanding the
issuer’s analysis of financial performance,
financial condition and liquidity.</TBLCELL>
