<BLOCK1>
<TI>Introduction</TI>
<P>This update to <EM>Federal Courts Practice 2021</EM> covers developments
during the period July 1, 2020 to February 1, 2021. It has three parts.</P>
<P>The first part sets out proposed amendments affecting the <EM>Federal
Courts Act</EM>, the <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM> or the <EM>Federal Courts
Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules</EM>. The second part
lists Practice Directions and Notices to the Parties and the Profession issued
by the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court. The final part contains
annotations of relevant cases.</P>

<N>I</N>
<TI>Legislative Amendments</TI>
<P>No amendments to the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM>, <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM>
or the <EM>Federal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules</EM>
were introduced during the period covered by this update.</P>
<P>A number of amendments introduced prior to July 1, 2020 have not yet been
proclaimed in force. These are: (1) amendments to sections 18.3(2) and 57(1) of
the <EM>Federal Courts Act</EM> enacted in 2019; (2) two sets of amendments to
the <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM>, pre-published in the <EM>Canada Gazette</EM>,
Part I, on November 7, 2016 and June 7, 2017 respectively; and (3) amendments to
the <EM>Federal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules</EM>
pre-published in the <EM>Canada Gazette</EM>, Part 1 on September 9, 2017.</P>
<P>Section 71 of the <EM>College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants
Act</EM>, S.C. 2019, which came into force on December 9, 2020, provides that
the College is to be named as the respondent in an application for judicial
review of a decision of the College or its committees. Rule 5(2) of the <EM>Federal
Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules</EM> should be read
in its light.</P>

<TI>Federal Court of Appeal</TI>
<P>On September 1, 2020, the Chief Justice issued a Notice on the resumption of
in-person hearings in the Court of Appeal and on the inapplicability of the
<EM>Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19)</EM>, S.C. 2020, c. 11 on time
limits established under the <EM>Federal Courts Rules</EM> or set by the Court
in an order: see, as well, <CASEREF CCDBNUM="2005311">

<TI>Federal Court</TI>
<P>On September 8, 2020 the Chief Justice issued an update to its previous
practice directions regarding COVID-19. The update clarified that the Court's
COVID-19 Orders and practice directions, as well as its intervening judgments,
orders and directions, were not affected by the <EM>Time Limits and Other
Periods Act (COVID-19)</EM>, S.C. 2020, c. 11. It also continued the Court's
practice with respect to certain administrative matters adopted in previous
practice directions.</P>
<P>On November 4, 2020, the Federal Court issued a guide to in-person hearings
in light of COVID-19.</P>
<P>On January 18, 2021, the Federal Court issued a Practice Direction
(COVID-19): Update #7 announcing that the Court's facilities in Quebec and
Ontario were closed until further notice but that the Court would continue to
conduct its operations by video conference, teleconference and in writing.
Elsewhere in Canada, the Court's operations would continue as they had been over
the past several months. The Practice Direction also covered a number of
procedural matters including in-person hearings and electronic filing.</P>
<P>On January 18, 2021 the Chief Justice issued a Notice setting out a document
retention schedule for court records pursuant to rule 23.1 of the <EM>Federal
Courts Rules</EM>.</P>

complied with the duty of procedural fairness. While the jurisprudence holds
that the standard of review is correctness, allegations of breach of the duty of

scheme does not on its own preclude applications for judicial review of
decisions, or of aspects of decisions, to which the appeal mechanism does not
apply, or by individuals who have no right of appeal. But any such application

reasonableness review that applies on judicial review cannot then be rebutted by
reference to the statutory appeal mechanism.</P>

</CASEREF>&mdash;Administrative agencies do not require an express grant of
statutory authority in order to use
&ldquo;soft law&rdquo; such as policy statements, guidelines, manuals and
handbooks to structure the exercise of their discretion. Such internal guidance
is not restricted to questions of law and policy and may, in certain
circumstances, extend to factual issues. However, the guidance must not
compromise the independence of the decision-makers and their capacity to decide
on the basis of the particular facts of each case and of their opinions.</P>

<TI>Grounds for Review&mdash;Natural Justice or Procedural Fitness or
Procedure required by Law</TI>
<BLOCK6>
<TI>General Principles</TI>
<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="1998166">
<SOC>Brown v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FCA 130</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Where a decision affects the rights, privileges or interests of
an individual, the common law duty of fairness is triggered. The greater the
effect the decision has on the life of an individual, the more robust will be
the procedural protections required to fulfill the duty of fairness and the
requirements of fundamental justice under section 7 of the
<EM>Charter</EM>. At a minimum, the duty of fairness requires that the affected
person know the case they have to meet and have an adequate opportunity to
respond.</P>
<P>While administrative bodies enjoy the autonomy to control their own
procedures, they must nonetheless observe procedural fairness. Only statutory
language or necessary implication can displace the duty of procedural fairness.</P>
<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2025029">
<SOC>McKenzie v. Mikisew Cree First Nation</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FC 1184</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;First Nations custom cannot override principles of natural
justice or procedural fairness.</P>
<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2024707">
<SOC>Perez v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FC 1171</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Procedural fairness issues are not reviewed on the
reasonableness standard, even where they involve application of statutory
procedural requirements. The distinctions between the rules of natural justice
and the duty of fairness have been largely eroded such that the terms tend to
now be used effectively interchangeably.</P>
<P>The principles of procedural fairness do not provide an untrammeled right to
be heard, but the right to a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Where a party
does not take advantage of that opportunity, or their actions or omissions
result in them being unable to do so, procedural fairness does not automatically
give them the right to another opportunity to be heard.</P>
</BLOCK6>

<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2010705">
<SOC>Beddows v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC>

<SOC>Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees
and Citizenship)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FCA 196</CITE>

structure of a decision-making body or the way it operates, even if the actions
or words of an individual decision-maker are blameless.</P>
<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2020911">
<SOC>Gardaworld Cash Services Canada Corporation v. Smith</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FC 1108</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Providing information and assistance to self-represented
litigants to help them understand the administrative process does not, in and of
themselves, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Yet, the requirement
of impartiality remains, and a decision-maker must not become the litigants'
advocate.</P>

<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2001155">
<SOC>Girouard v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FCA 129</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;In determining the content of procedural fairness, what is most
important is that administrative decisions are made using a fair and open
procedure, appropriate to the decision being made and its statutory,
institutional, and social context, with an opportunity for those affected by the
decision to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered
by the decision-maker. The requirements set out by Parliament, the procedural
choices an administrative agency may make, and the importance of the decision to
the affected person must also be taken into account.</P>
<P><CASEREF CCDBNUM="2001155">
<SOC>Girouard v. Canada (Attorney General)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FCA 129</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Generally, any breach of the principles of procedural fairness,
particularly of the right to be heard, will result in the incorrect decision
being set aside, without regard to the effect the violation might have had on
the decision. However, an exception may be made when the error committed by the
administrative agency is not determinative and the result would have inevitably
been the same had the violation not occurred.</P>

</CASEREF>&mdash;The object of notice is to ensure that the persons directly
affected by a pending decision are provided with sufficient information and
opportunities to meet the case against them. What is sufficient varies with each
case, informed by the level of procedural fairness due in the circumstances. The
notice requirement does not extend to draft decisions or memoranda written to
inform a decision-maker. Unless new and relevant information that would
influence the disposition comes to the decision-maker's attention, there is no
requirement to go back to the applicant for further commentary.</P>

is raised, not the form. The true subject matter of an appeal may be identified
by construing the notice of appeal. The appellant's memorandum of fact and law

</CASEREF>&mdash;Even where the Court is satisfied that the two grounds in
section 40(4) for granting leave&mdash;the proceeding is not an abuse of process
and there are reasonable grounds for it&mdash;are met, the Court still has a
residual discretion not to grant leave. Vexatious litigants bear the burden of
proving that leave should be granted on a balance of probabilities, and must
provide evidence in a supporting affidavit.</P>
<P>Abuse of process can include relitigating issues and starting litigation to
injure someone or pursue a personal vendetta rather than seeking genuinely
needed remedies. This Court has occasionally suggested that a vexatious litigant
must show a <EM>bona fide</EM> reason for starting a new proceeding. A
proceeding started for a <EM>bona fide</EM> reason can still be prosecuted
abusively. Thus, before granting leave, the Court needs an assurance that the
vexatious litigant will prosecute the proceeding in an acceptable way. The
vexatious litigant's affidavit should address this.</P>
<P>The Court will be more inclined to grant leave where the affidavit promises&mdash;with
particularity&mdash;any or all of the following: a litigation plan,
representation by a trustworthy agent or counsel, access to and reliance upon
legal advice as the proceeding progresses, and compliance with the Rules, orders
and directions of the Court. This is a non-exhaustive list.</P>
<P>There must be reasonable grounds to suggest that the proposed proceeding has
some chance of success. It should not be doomed to fail. Cases in which success
will be difficult but not impossible to achieve meet this requirement. In
considering whether a proposed proceeding is doomed to fail, the Court must
consider the standard of review. Where, as here, a judicial review application
is proposed, the standard of review is reasonableness, and the vexatious
litigant faces a high hurdle.</P>
<P>Vexatious litigants must set out in their supporting affidavit a reasonable
factual and legal basis for the proceeding. The affidavit should include a draft
notice of application or draft statement of claim and describe or even append
the key supporting evidence. The more detailed the affidavit is, the better. But
it is not necessary for vexatious litigants to come anywhere close to proving
their cases: this is not a summary judgment motion. To grant leave, the Court
only has to be satisfied there is some arguable substance behind the proceeding.</P>
<P>It may be that the discretion allows the Court to grant leave on certain
conditions and to revoke leave if certain terms are not met. One possible term
is that the vexatious litigant propose an acceptable schedule or a litigation
plan. Another is that the vexatious litigant be represented by counsel.</P>

<CITE>2020 FC 983</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Settlement privilege requires the presence of three conditions:
a litigious dispute in existence or within contemplation; a communication made
with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the
court in the event negotiations failed; and a communication made with the
purpose to attempt to effect a settlement. However, there is an exception where
the communication subject to privilege is not used as evidence of liability for
the conduct which is the subject of negotiations or of weak cause of action, but
is used for other purposes. In those circumstances, the privilege does not bar
production in court. More specifically, where a dispute arises as to the
existence of a settlement agreement, it is necessary for the Court to have
access to documents exchanged by the parties or their counsel in order to
resolve the conflict.</P>

assessing costs according to the tariff usually leads to an award that is below

the prospect of paying a cost award of this magnitude fails to provide a
significant incentive to settle. Neither does it afford a reasonable
contribution to the prevailing party's legal expenses. For that reason, the
Court has often awarded costs in a lump sum that is significantly higher than
the amount resulting from the application of the tariff. Here, the Court set a

expert must, in the circumstances existing at the time, have been prudent and
reasonable representation of the client; (b) the hiring of an expert must not
constitute a
&ldquo;blank cheque&rdquo; for an award; and (c) what reliance was placed on the
expert's testimony by the trial judge.</P>

</CASEREF>&mdash;With respect to photocopying disbursements, any comparison to
the $0.40 per page charged by the Registry in Tariff A 1(3) is irrelevant
because that is predicated on a different rationale for partial cost recovery
from users of the Court. Nonetheless, a result of zero for photocopying would be
inappropriate, since it is evident that necessary costs were incurred. In the
absence of fulsome submissions on the matter, the Assessment Officer determined
that a lump sum, which was approximately one-third of the amount claimed at
$0.40 per page, would be appropriate.</P>

</CASEREF>&mdash;An expense for translating documents from French into English
was disallowed. The situation could not be compared to the cost of translation
from foreign languages, which is easily recognized as a necessary disbursement.
Every Canadian may choose to use English or French in proceedings before the
Court. A person exercising that right should not bear the burden of translating
his or her statements in the other language, whether directly or by way of a
costs award. Were it otherwise, such a shifting of translation costs would not
operate in a symmetrical fashion and would amount, in most cases, to a tax on
the use of French.</P>

<SOC>Bauer Hockey Ltd. v. Sport Maska Inc. (CCM Hockey)</SOC>
<CITE>2020 FC 862</CITE>
</CASEREF>&mdash;Rule 420 does not set aside the Court's discretion regarding
costs&mdash;it applies &ldquo;unless otherwise ordered.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the
language of &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; suggests that it is a rule that should
ordinarily be followed. There is good reason for this. The purpose of rule 420
is to provide an incentive to settlement. This incentive will be ineffective if
the doubling of costs is subject to unstructured discretion. Rather, the
consequence must be visible and reasonably certain. Thus, when rule 420 applies,
the percentage of recovery should be doubled for the period after the refusal of
an offer, save in exceptional circumstances.</P>
