<P>At issue was whether the plaintiff, Toronto Motorsports Park (TMP), was
required to comply with ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 56, ^SO2002c30SchA 57, ^SO2002c30SchA
58(1) and ^SO2002c30SchA 59 (Motor Vehicle Repairs) of the Act and failure to do
so would trigger the provision of the <EM>Repair and Storage Liens Act</EM>
that declares that no repairer's lien arises if these provisions of the CPA are
not complied with. The vehicle was leased to a corporation for use by that
corporation's president. The individual arranged for the repair work on the
vehicle, a Ferrari. The Court held that when TMP undertook to repair the
Ferrari, the person requesting the repairs was doing so as president of a
corporation, not in a personal capacity. Therefore, the CPA did not apply to
this transaction.</P>

students are included in the definition of &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; in s.
^SO2002c30SchA 1 of the Act. Even though college students may be taking business
or professional programs to obtain job credentials for the future, they are
still &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; of educational services. Only if someone already
has an established (i.e. current) business and purchases educational services to
further that business do they fall outside the protection of the CPA. A court
will generally find someone to have a business purpose if they are acting in a
professional or business capacity at the time of the transaction.</P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. The plaintiffs disputed the
arbitration clause in the phone service contracts between the class members and
TELUS Communications Inc. The Court held that the arbitration clause is invalid
to the extent that it violates the rights of class members who qualify as
&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; under the CPA. In particular, the Court refused to
enforce the arbitration clause against consumers because it infringed ss.
^SO2002c30SchA 7(2) and ^SO2002c30SchA 8 of the CPA by preventing consumers from
commencing or joining a class action. Section ^SO2002c30SchA 7(5) of the CPA
also restricted the Court from ordering a stay of proceedings under the <EM>Arbitration
Act</EM> against consumers. However, the Court held that business customers did
not qualify as &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; under the CPA and therefore, they could
not invoke protections that were available to consumers under ss. ^SO2002c30SchA
7(2), ^SO2002c30SchA 7(5), and ^SO2002c30SchA 8.</P>

<P>A motion for certification of a class action alleging that an HVAC rental
company breached the CPA. The alleged facts are that once the HVAC equipment was
rented a security interest was put in place against the consumer's property.
This lien was not authorized by the rental agreement (which was &ldquo;misleading
and deceptive&rdquo;) and the &ldquo;buyout program&rdquo; for the equipment
also went undisclosed. Common issues posed by the potential class include breach
of ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 14 and ^SO2002c30SchA 15 of the CPA (unfair practice) as
well as the regulations under the Act regarding leasing as well as the direct
agreement requirements in Part IV. The Court also engages in a summary judgment
analysis on whether the rental agreements were in contravention of the CPA's
requirements and regulations. The Court held that there was a genuine issue for
trial, mainly that Home Trust Company was not necessarily a &ldquo;supplier&rdquo;
under the CPA and the plaintiffs were raising new points of law that could not
be settled without a trial. Partial summary judgment was denied.</P>

attention of the parties and permit argument on issues relating to the Act prior
to ruling on them, where this is not done, there is no prejudice by the
application of the Act and by the conclusion that it imposes an implied warranty

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. The Court held that Peoples
Trust Company's Single Load Prepaid Cards (&ldquo;SLP cards&rdquo;) are not a
financial product exempt under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 2(2)(c) from the operation of
the CPA because they were marketed as gifts, which by their nature are generally
intended for personal purposes. Instead, the Court found that the SLP cards are
open loop gift cards regulated by O. Reg. 17/05 and indistinguishable from mall
cards. In contrast, the Court held that Peoples Trust Company's General Purpose
Reloadable Prepaid Cards (&ldquo;GPR cards&rdquo;) are a financial product
exempt from the CPA by virtue of s. ^SO2002c30SchA 2(2)(c) because, through the
means of access to a payment network, the end of GPR cards is banking.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs brought an action for rescission of agreements for the
purchase and sale of pre-construction homes along with damages. The defendants
brought a motion for an order staying the action in accordance with the
arbitration clause in the agreements. The Court acknowledged that the CPA was
enacted to prevent arbitration clauses from binding consumers in certain types
of consumer contracts. However, the Ontario legislature specifically endorsed
arbitration as an appropriate dispute resolution forum in the context of real
estate transactions by excluding real estate transactions in s. ^SO2002c30SchA
2(2)(f) of the CPA.</P>

<P>The plaintiff purchased a season pass at a ski resort and signed a waiver
for recreational use of the property. While skiing at the defendant's ski
resort, the plaintiff got injured and thus filed a motion claiming that s.
^SO2002c30SchA 7(1) of the CPA be applied to vitiate the defendant's waiver of

CPA, the defendant cannot disclaim liability for any breach of the warranty
contemplated by s. ^SO2002c30SchA 9(1) of the CPA. As such, the lower Court read
down the waiver to exclude claims that involved the protection of substantive
and procedural rights contemplated by the CPA, while the remainder of the waiver
was held to be enforceable. On appeal, the ONCA held that ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 7
and ^SO2002c30SchA 9 of CPA fundamentally undermined the purpose of s. 3(3) of
the <EM>Occupiers' Liability Act</EM> (&ldquo;OLA&rdquo;). These sections under
the CPA were irreconcilable and conflicted. Accordingly, the more specific
provisions of the OLA prevailed over the general provisions in CPA.</P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. The plaintiffs disputed the
arbitration clause in the phone service contracts between the class members and
TELUS Communications Inc. The Court held that the arbitration clause is invalid
to the extent that it violates the rights of class members who qualify as
&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; under the CPA. In particular, the Court refused to
enforce the arbitration clause against consumers because it infringed ss.
^SO2002c30SchA 7(2) and ^SO2002c30SchA 8 of the CPA by preventing consumers from
commencing or joining a class action. Section ^SO2002c30SchA 7(5) of the CPA
also restricted the Court from ordering a stay of proceedings under the <EM>Arbitration
Act</EM> against consumers. However, the Court held that business customers did
not qualify as &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; under the CPA and therefore, they could
not invoke protections that were available to consumers under ss. ^SO2002c30SchA
7(2), ^SO2002c30SchA 7(5), and ^SO2002c30SchA 8.</P>

was held to be enforceable. On appeal, the ONCA held that ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 7
and ^SO2002c30SchA 9 of CPA fundamentally undermined the purpose of s. 3(3) of
<EM>Occupiers' Liability Act</EM>. These sections under the CPA were
irreconcilable and conflicted. Accordingly, the more specific provisions of the
<EM>Occupiers' Liability Act</EM> prevailed over the general provisions in CPA.</P>

<P>A clause in a contract that required changes to be in writing did not
preclude a home renovator's claims for compensation for work agreed to orally.
This clause was found to apply to all renovation work completed, whether within
the scope of the written contract or not, based on the provision (s. 11) that
any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the defendant homeowners. However,
the Court ordered that the consumer is bound by the agreement because it would
be inequitable for the consumer not to be bound, as per s. 93(2). It would have
been inequitable for the defendant homeowners to receive the benefit of the
invoiced items without paying for them.</P>

the property turned out to be inaccessible. Despite the cancellation, they were
given an invoice for the delivery of the propane gas. The plaintiffs relied on
s. ^SO2002c30SchA 13 of the CPA which states that &ldquo;a recipient of
unsolicited goods or services has no legal obligation in respect of their use or
disposal&rdquo;. The Small Claims Court held that in this situation, the CPA

was no breach of s. ^SO2002c30SchA 13 of the CPA.</P>

<P>A motion for certification of a class action alleging that an HVAC rental
company breached the CPA. The alleged facts are that once the HVAC equipment was
rented, a security interest was put in place against the consumer's property.
This lien was not authorized by the rental agreement (which was &ldquo;misleading
and deceptive&rdquo;) and the &ldquo;buyout program&rdquo; for the equipment
also went undisclosed. Common issues posed by the potential class include breach
of ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 14 and ^SO2002c30SchA 15 of the CPA (unfair practice) as
well as the regulations under the Act regarding leasing, and the direct
agreement requirements in Part IV. The Court also engaged in a summary judgment
analysis on whether the rental agreements were in contravention of the CPA's
requirements and regulations. The Court held that there was a genuine issue for
trial, mainly that Home Trust Company was not necessarily a &ldquo;supplier&rdquo;
under the CPA and the plaintiffs were raising new points of law that could not
be settled without a trial. Partial summary judgment was denied.</P>

scheduling, the defendants' counterclaimed, alleging that the plaintiff engaged
in unfair practice pursuant to s. ^SO2002c30SchA 14 of CPA. The Court dismissed
the counterclaim. The Court stated that the timeline and scheduling

<P>The plaintiffs brought a motion before the Court seeking certification as a
class action and alleging that the compensation package provided by Samsung for
its Galaxy Note7 cell phones, which overheated and were recalled, was
inadequate. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for certification in part
because the plaintiffs' claim for misrepresentation under ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 14
and ^SO2002c30SchA 17 of the CPA was so broadly and generically pleaded that it
was not possible to discern precisely what was being alleged. In particular, the
pleadings failed to identify when, where, by and to whom, and how the
representation was made. The Court also found that the plaintiffs' claim for
misrepresentation under ss. ^SO2002c30SchA 14 and ^SO2002c30SchA 17 could not
succeed because Samsung, as a manufacturer of the Galaxy Note7 cell phones, is
not a &ldquo;supplier&rdquo; under the CPA. Since the plaintiffs' pleadings did
not include any &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; entered into between the plaintiffs and
Samsung, there is no contractual privity between them and no agreement to
rescind or money to refund under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18 of the CPA.</P>

that the knowledge of the supplier who knew, or ought to have known, that the
price charged grossly exceeded the price at which similar goods or services were
readily available to like customers is not conclusive, but rather, one factor to

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. The Court found that Peoples
Trust Company engaged in unfair practices or misrepresentations contrary to ss.
^SO2002c30SchA 14&ndash;17 of the CPA because (1) no additional fees were
apparent to purchasers of Peoples Trust Company's Single Load Prepaid Cards (&ldquo;SLP

for the application fee, (2) nothing on the external packaging or face of the
SLP cards warns of the consequences of expiry, (3) not all fees are disclosed by
Peoples Trust Company on their SLP cards, and (4) Peoples Trust Company's
cardholder agreements mislead consumers about their rights to expired balances.</P>

<P>Where a vendor and consumer do not make an agreement &ldquo;after or while&rdquo;
the vendor has engaged in an unfair practice, it will not be held to have
engaged in unfair practices under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18. The &ldquo;Unfair
Practices&rdquo; section is concerned with representations inducing a consumer
agreement and the protection of consumers who may otherwise enter agreements
based on deceptive or unconscionable representations. A consumer who signed an
agreement, without the presence of a deceptive or unconscionable representation,
but while the vendor was making deceptive or unconscionable representations to
others, cannot advance a claim for relief under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18(1).</P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. Peoples Trust Company argued
that Bernstein, the representative plaintiff, violated the notice requirement in
s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18(3) of the CPA because she brought her claim more than a
year after receiving her Peoples Trust Company payment card. However, the Court
waived the notice requirement using its broad discretion in s. ^SO2002c30SchA
101 because it was in the interests of justice for two reasons. First, the Court
found that the waiver was superfluous in this case because the notice
requirement is not a precondition to either bringing an action under s.
^SO2002c30SchA 100 of the CPA or demanding a refund from a supplier who has
charged illegal fees on open loop gift cards contrary to O. Reg. 17/05. In
addition, there is no notice requirement for a common law action for breach of
contract or for unjust enrichment, both of which the class members successfully
brought before the Court. Second, to allow Peoples Trust Company to use the
notice requirement in s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18(3) as a shield after class members
have demonstrated that they have viable claims would inhibit access to justice.</P>

<P>A motion for certification of a class proceeding against Equifax. An alleged
cybersecurity incident occurred in July 2017 which exposed 20,000 Canadian
customers' personal information. The alleged violation fell under Part III of
the CPA. The claiming defendant represented that it had cybersecurity security
standards which did not exist. The Court held that if it took the facts as
pleaded, the defendant could be found in breach of the CPA, allowing the class
to claim damages under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18 of the Act. The Court certified the

</CASEREF>. These include: 
<P1>a. Punitive damages for a violation of consumer protection legislation must
have the purpose of discouraging the repetition of undesirable conduct and may
only be awarded in light of: (a) intentional, malicious or vexatious violations
of the legislation; or (b) conduct that displays ignorance, carelessness or
serious negligence assessed in light of the merchant's conduct both before and
after the violation.</P1> 
<P1>b. While punitive damages may be awarded under consumer protection statute
when the merchant's conduct is malicious, oppressive, high-handed or a marked
departure from ordinary standards of decency, which is a requirement for
punitive damages under the common law, such conduct is not a prerequisite for an
award of punitive damages under the consumer protection statute.</P1> 
<P1>c. The fact that in a class action, the award of damages may in and of
itself have a preventative and deterrent effect does not impose a higher
threshold for awarding punitive damages, and the amount of the class action
award is not a factor in the legal test for the determination of punitive
damages for the class members.</P1> 
<P1>d. Neither evidence of antisocial behaviour nor reprehensible conduct is
required to award punitive damages; rather, what is necessary is an examination
of the overall conduct of the merchant, before, during and after the violation,
for behaviour that was: (a) lax, passive or ignorant with respect to consumers'
rights and to their own obligations; or (b) conduct that displays ignorance,
carelessness or serious negligence.</P1> 
<P1>e. The whole of the merchant's conduct must be analyzed to determine
whether the imperatives of prevention justify an award of punitive damages.</P1>

<P1>f. The amount of the award of punitive damages must be rationally connected
to the purposes for which the punitive damages are awarded. Rationally connected
factors include: whether the merchant was diligent in observing its obligations
under the consumer protection legislation; the seriousness of the violation,
whether the merchant manifested disregard for its obligations; whether the
merchant's conduct was willful or intentional; how the merchant responded to the
consumer's complaint or grievance; and whether the merchant provided
explanations or justifications for the violation.</P1></P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This case was decided by a justice of the peace.
Consumers alleged that the defendants excessively overcharged them for
electrical services in the aftermath of an ice storm that left many without
power and electricity. The defendants argued that the agreements they entered
into with consumers were not direct agreements within the meaning of the CPA.
The Court held that the definition of &ldquo;direct agreement&rdquo; in s.
^SO2002c30SchA 20(1) includes agreements entered into at consumers' residences
or dwellings regardless of who solicited the transaction. In other words, direct
agreements are not limited to situations where door-to-door salespersons solicit
consumers to enter into agreements for goods or services; they also include
situations where consumers solicit suppliers for goods or services. The key
consideration is where the agreement takes place, not who contacted who first.</P>

<P>The supplier unilaterally amended the consumer agreement, but failed to
comply with s. ^OReg17/05 42(2)2 of O. Reg. 17/05 because it did not give the
consumer the right to retain the existing agreement unchanged or the right to
terminate the amended agreement. In particular, the Court held that if a
consumer is given the right to terminate as an alternative to accepting an
amended, renewed or extended consumer agreement as per s. ^OReg17/05 42(2)2,
such right must be unconditional. An agreement that attaches conditions to the
right to terminate does not provide the consumer with a true alternative to
accepting the amendment. The two conditions imposed by the supplier that
violated s. ^OReg17/05 42(2)2 were that in order to terminate (1) the consumer
must not be in default under the agreement and (2) the consumer must pay the
standard removal charges.</P>

Trust Company's Single Load Prepaid Cards (&ldquo;SLP cards&rdquo;) are not a
financial product exempt under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 2(2)(c) from the operation of

open loop gift cards regulated by O. Reg. 17/05 and indistinguishable from mall

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. The Court held that there is
no actual gifting requirement in an open loop gift card agreement. Through its
analysis of legislative history, the Court concluded that the Government of
Ontario never intended that gifting be a prerequisite to the protection provided
to consumers by O. Reg. 17/05. In addition, the Court found that there is no
requirement that the card entitle the holder to purchase any specific good or
service. Rather, the term &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; in the &ldquo;open loop gift
card agreement&rdquo; definition is an entitlement to &ldquo;apply&rdquo; the
voucher towards goods and services &ldquo;from multiple unaffiliated sellers.&rdquo;</P>

<P>The general purpose of the CPA is to protect consumers; however, it can also
work to protect suppliers who are being taken advantage of by deceitful
consumers. Where a homeowner refuses to pay a contractor on the basis that there
is no written contract between the parties, and it is beyond doubt that both
parties knew and understood the terms of the contract, the Court has the
jurisdiction, under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2) of the Act, to order a consumer
bound by the agreement between the parties. Relevant factors to consider when
determining whether a consumer should be bound by an agreement not in accordance
with the Act include: 
<P1>a. the seriousness of the consequences of invalidating the contract;</P1> 
<P1>b. the social utility of those consequences;</P1> 
<P1>c. the class of persons for whom the prohibition was enacted, whether the
contract was bargained for at arm's length;</P1> 
<P1>d. whether the consumer was unfairly taken advantage of, whether the
agreement was wholly or substantially completed;</P1> 
<P1>e. the degree of benefit derived by the consumer; and</P1> 
<P1>f. and whether it would be inherently wrong or contrary to public policy to
enforce the contract.</P1></P>

<P>The gift card regulations found in O. Reg 17/05 do not apply to prepaid
phone cards. The purpose of these regulations is to prevent the expiry of an
agreement before the seller of the card has delivered the goods or performed the
services promised under the agreement. They do not prohibit an agreement being
time-limited. The fact that the service purchased was for a defined period of
wireless service, calculated on the dollar value of credits the consumer added
to the account, was not a breach of the regulations, as concluding otherwise
would mean that Bell was required to keep the wireless service and number
available to the customer indefinitely, a patently unreasonable outcome.
Informing this decision was the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission's decision to decline to require service providers to permit
consumers to carry over their prepaid unused minutes indefinitely, choosing to
require a 7-day grace period instead (which Bell adopted in its agreements). In
view of these findings, it was not necessary to decide whether the Regulation
applies only to gift cards purchased as gifts, or whether the case fell within
the single service exception.</P>

Trust Company's payment cards are not &ldquo;single service&rdquo; cards
exempted from the operation of O. Reg. 17/05 by s. 25.1(1)(b) of the Regulation.
The exemption in s. 25.1(1)(b) was intended to provide an exception regarding

manicure, massage, etc.). However, Peoples Trust Company offers a variety of
services in relation to its payment cards and consumers can use its payment
cards to access many different goods and services.</P>

Single Load Prepaid Cards (&ldquo;SLP cards&rdquo;) and retaining consumers'
balances on its SLP cards through &ldquo;cancellation fees&rdquo; after they had
expired.</P>
<P>The Court held that Peoples Trust Company violated s. ^OReg17/05 25.4 of O.

Consumers alleged that the defendants excessively overcharged them for

power and electricity. Where consumers cancelled their direct agreements under
s. ^SO2002c30SchA 43 of the CPA, the Court held that the defendants (i.e.

a corporation for use by that corporation's president. The individual arranged
for the repair work on the vehicle, a Ferrari. The Court held that when TMP
undertook to repair the Ferrari, the person requesting the repairs was doing so
as president of a corporation, not in a personal capacity. Therefore, the CPA
did not apply to this transaction.</P>

<P>The CPA is cited in this case for its intersection with the RSLA. However,
the Court's judgment focuses on the RSLA rather than the CPA. The Court held
that even if Konarski had a consumer agreement, no estimate for car storage
services was given to the consumer in contravention of s. ^SO2002c30SchA 56(1)
of the CPA nor did any exception under s. 56(2) apply to the situation.
Moreover, no written agreement was signed (against s. 58(1) and s. 59 prescribed
regulations). This case arose from a dispute between the widow of a vehicle
owner and the deceased man's friend who stored a number of vehicles&mdash;either
as a favour or for payment. The case turns on the impact of certain features to
follow the CPA on rights under the RSLA. The widow was held to be a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;
in her dealings with the repairer/storer; no written estimates were provided for
repairs; no proper disclosure of the contract was made (CPA s. ^SO2002c30SchA
56(1)); therefore no lien rights for repairs could be asserted. The Court found
the defendant to be a repairer and not a storer.</P>

<P>This case deals with Part VI of the CPA. Under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 56(1),
&ldquo;no repairer shall charge a consumer for any work or repairs unless the
repairer first gives the consumer an estimate that meets the prescribed
requirements&rdquo;. The plaintiff argued that the company was not subject to
the CPA because it was not a &ldquo;repairer&rdquo; but a &ldquo;restorer&rdquo;

subject to the CPA as &ldquo;restore&rdquo; and &ldquo;repair&rdquo; are used

accordance with the CPA (s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(1)), the Court found it would be
inequitable for the defendant not to be bound to the agreement (s.

<P>The defendant was a co-applicant on a credit card issued by the Royal Bank
of Canada (RBC). The RBC brought a motion for summary judgment, seeking payment
of the balance owing on the credit card. The Court held that s. ^SO2002c30SchA
68(1) of the CPA makes it clear that once a consumer uses a credit card, they
are deemed to have entered into a credit agreement with the issuer of the card.
Therefore, although the defendant did not apply for the credit card, she agreed
to the terms of the credit agreement with RBC by virtue of using the card.</P>

<P>The deputy judge held that the vehicle lease agreement did not bind the
defendant, as the same was not in compliance with O. Reg. 17/05 read with s.
^SO2002c30SchA 89 of the CPA. Further, s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(1) of the CPA
relieves a consumer of any liability under a consumer agreement unless it was
prepared in accordance with the Act and its Regulations. On appeal, the
Appellate Court found that the plaintiff did provide a written lease disclosure
form that formed part of the vehicle lease agreement as required by O. Reg.
17/05. Because the lease disclosure form was signed and initiated by the
defendant and the calculations of amounts owing and capitalized payments under
the lease were clear, the Appellate Court held that subject to a gas card issue,
the plaintiff complied with its disclosure requirements under s. ^SO2002c30SchA
89 of the CPA. <EM>See also</EM>: <CASEREF>

<P>Looking to realize on loans made to the defendant borrowers, the plaintiff
lender is found to have breached the Act in several ways with the main breach
being that it did not forward any disclosure whatsoever to the borrowers as
legislated by the Act. Despite the application of s. 70 which mandated that the
defendents pay no interest, s. 93 was applied to allow the judge to set an
interest rate of 5%, as it would be inequitable for the defendants not to pay
any interest for their loans which allowed them to prosecute their motor vehicle
accident cases, all of which resulted in recoveries for the borrowers. Also, the
defendants would have known that they were not getting the use of the money
interest free.</P>

<P>A clause in a contract that required changes to be in writing did not
preclude a home renovator's claims for compensation for work agreed to orally.
This clause was found to apply to all renovation work completed, whether within
the scope of the written contract or not, based on the provision (s. 11) that
any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the defendant homeowners. However,
the Court ordered that the consumer is bound by the agreement because it would
be inequitable for the consumer not to be bound, as per s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2).
It would have been inequitable for the defendant homeowners to receive the

<P>The general purpose of the CPA is to protect consumers; however, it can also
work to protect suppliers who are being taken advantage of by deceitful
consumers. Where a homeowner refuses to pay a contractor on the basis that there
is no written contract between the parties, and it is beyond doubt that both
parties knew and understood the terms of the contract, the Court has the
jurisdiction, under s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2) of the Act, to order a consumer
bound by the agreement between the parties. Relevant factors to consider when
determining whether a consumer should be bound by an agreement not in accordance
with the Act include: 
<P1>a. the seriousness of the consequences of invalidating the contract;</P1> 
<P1>b. the social utility of those consequences;</P1> 
<P1>c. the class of persons for whom the prohibition was enacted;</P1> 
<P1>d. whether the contract was bargained for at arm's length;</P1> 
<P1>e. whether the consumer was unfairly taken advantage of;</P1> 
<P1>f. whether the agreement was wholly or substantially completed</P1> 
<P1>g. the degree of benefit derived by the consumer, and;</P1> 
<P1>h. whether it would be inherently wrong or contrary to public policy to
enforce the contract.</P1></P>

<P>The Court held that s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2) of the CPA applied even though
the consumer was not attempting to resile from the entire agreement, only the
amendment made by the supplier. The Court found that the wording &ldquo;all or a
portion or portions of a consumer agreement&rdquo; in s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2) is
broad enough to include an amendment to an agreement. In addition, the Court
held that the test for applying s. ^SO2002c30SchA 93(2) is not the nature of the
non-compliance, but rather, whether it would be inequitable for a consumer not
to be bound by the amendment. Nonetheless, consideration of the nature of the
non-compliance remains a factor because the greater the deviation from the
legislative scheme, the more likely that a court will find that it would not be
inequitable for a consumer not to be bound by the amendment. In this case, the
Court held that it would be inequitable for the consumer not to be bound by the
supplier's amendment because the amendment does not prejudice the consumer and
the consumer brought the application for a collateral purpose.</P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This case was decided by a justice of the peace.
Consumers alleged that the defendants excessively overcharged them for
electrical services in the aftermath of an ice storm that left many without
power and electricity. The Court held that 11 agreements between consumers and
the defendants were direct agreements within the meaning of the CPA and s.
^SO2002c30SchA 96(1) obligated the defendants to refund any payments provided by
consumers under these agreements, such as the 30% deposit fee, because the
defendants were not legally entitled to ask consumers for such payments. The
Court further held that a supplier's refund obligation is automatic and does not
require a former demand for the refund. In other words, once consumers notified
the defendants that they were cancelling the direct agreements, the defendants
were obligated under ss. ^OReg17/05 79(1) and ^OReg17/05 80(1) of O. Reg. 17/05
to refund any payment made by the consumers under the direct agreements
regardless of whether the consumers had actually requested a refund.</P>

<P><BOLD>Note:</BOLD> This is a class proceeding. Peoples Trust Company argued
that Bernstein, the representative plaintiff, violated the notice requirement in
s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18(3) of the CPA because she brought her claim more than a
year after receiving her Peoples Trust Company payment card. However, the Court
waived the notice requirement using its broad discretion in s. ^SO2002c30SchA
101 because it was in the interests of justice for two reasons. First, the Court
found that the waiver was superfluous in this case because the notice
requirement is not a precondition to either bringing an action under s.
^SO2002c30SchA 100 of the CPA or demanding a refund from a supplier who has
charged illegal fees on open loop gift cards contrary to O. Reg. 17/05. In
addition, there is no notice requirement for a common law action for breach of
contract or for unjust enrichment, both of which the class members successfully
brought before the Court. Second, to allow Peoples Trust Company to use the
notice requirement in s. ^SO2002c30SchA 18(3) as a shield after class members
have demonstrated that they have viable claims would inhibit access to justice.</P>
<P>In its decision to award punitive damages, the Court endorsed the principles
articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <CASEREF CCDBNUM="1228877">

</CASEREF>. These include: 
<P1>a. Punitive damages for a violation of consumer protection legislation must
have the purpose of discouraging the repetition of undesirable conduct and may
only be awarded in light of: (a) intentional, malicious or vexatious violations
of the legislation; or (b) conduct that displays ignorance, carelessness or
serious negligence assessed in light of the merchant's conduct both before and
after the violation.</P1> 
<P1>b. While punitive damages may be awarded under consumer protection statute
when the merchant's conduct is malicious, oppressive, high-handed or a marked
departure from ordinary standards of decency, which is a requirement for
punitive damages under the common law, such conduct is not a prerequisite for an
award of punitive damages under the consumer protection statute.</P1> 
<P1>c. The fact that in a class action, the award of damages may in and of
itself have a preventative and deterrent effect does not impose a higher
threshold for awarding punitive damages, and the amount of the class action
award is not a factor in the legal test for the determination of punitive
damages for the class members.</P1> 
<P1>d. Neither evidence of antisocial behaviour nor reprehensible conduct is
required to award punitive damages; rather, what is necessary is an examination
of the overall conduct of the merchant, before, during and after the violation,
for behaviour that was: (a) lax, passive or ignorant with respect to consumers'
rights and to their own obligations; or (b) conduct that displays ignorance,
carelessness or serious negligence.</P1> 
<P1>e. The whole of the merchant's conduct must be analyzed to determine
whether the imperatives of prevention justify an award of punitive damages.</P1>

<P1>f. The amount of the award of punitive damages must be rationally connected
to the purposes for which the punitive damages are awarded. Rationally connected
factors include: whether the merchant was diligent in observing its obligations
under the consumer protection legislation; the seriousness of the violation,
whether the merchant manifested disregard for its obligations; whether the
merchant's conduct was willful or intentional; how the merchant responded to the
consumer's complaint or grievance; and whether the merchant provided
explanations or justifications for the violation.</P1></P>
